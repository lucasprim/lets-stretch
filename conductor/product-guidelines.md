# Product Guidelines - Let's Stretch

## Voice and Tone

**Playful and fun.** Light-hearted language that makes stretching enjoyable rather than a chore. Use casual, encouraging phrasing. The app should feel like a friendly nudge from a workout buddy, not a medical reminder.

Examples:
- "Time to wiggle those shoulders!" (not "Perform shoulder rotation exercise")
- "Your back called. It wants a stretch." (not "Back stretch reminder")
- "Nice one! You just earned your flexibility points." (not "Exercise completed")

## Design Principles

1. **Delightful UX first** - Prioritize a beautiful, enjoyable user experience. Every interaction should bring a small moment of joy.
2. **Non-intrusive and respectful** - Never interrupt flow aggressively. Respect the user's focus and current task. Gentle nudges, not alarms.
3. **Simplicity over features** - Keep it minimal. Do one thing well. Resist feature creep. If it doesn't directly help someone stretch, it probably doesn't belong.

## Visual Standards

- Follow macOS design language and Human Interface Guidelines
- Use animations that are smooth, subtle, and purposeful
- Prefer illustrations/icons over text-heavy interfaces
- Light and airy color palette that feels calming and energizing

## Content Standards

- Keep all UI text short and scannable
- Use active voice and present tense
- Stretch names should be friendly, not clinical
- Include brief, clear movement instructions (3-5 steps max)
