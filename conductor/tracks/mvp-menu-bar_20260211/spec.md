# Specification: MVP Menu Bar App

**Track ID:** mvp-menu-bar_20260211
**Type:** Feature
**Created:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** Draft

## Summary

Build the MVP of Let's Stretch as a macOS menu bar app that periodically reminds desk workers to stretch via a pulsing icon animation, then displays guided stretch instructions in a popup window. Includes an auto-play mode for multi-stretch sessions with configurable timing.

## Context

Let's Stretch is a Mac app for desk workers and remote workers who forget to stretch during long work sessions. The app should be playful, non-intrusive, and feel native to macOS. It lives in the menu bar and stays out of the way until it's time to move.

## User Story

As a desk worker, I want periodic stretch reminders with guided instructions so that I stay loose and pain-free throughout my workday.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] App lives in the macOS menu bar with a status icon
- [ ] Stretch reminders appear as a pulsing animation on the menu bar icon (not standard system notifications)
- [ ] Clicking the pulsing icon opens a popup/window with the stretch name and step-by-step instructions
- [ ] Each stretch includes text descriptions and detailed animations (sourced from the web)
- [ ] User can snooze or skip a stretch reminder
- [ ] Auto-play mode guides the user through multiple stretches with timing (e.g., 20s stretch - 5s rest interval - 20s stretch, or optimal stretch timing)
- [ ] Stretches are categorized: sitting/standing (desk-friendly) vs. mat-required
- [ ] User can filter which stretch categories are enabled (e.g., desk-only, or include mat stretches)
- [ ] Curated set of common, easy stretches included (researched for desk workers)
- [ ] Reminder interval is configurable by the user
- [ ] App can optionally launch at login
- [ ] App feels native to macOS with a playful, fun tone

## Dependencies

- **Stretch content:** Must research and curate a set of common desk-worker stretches with descriptions, instructions, and animation references. This is part of this track.
- **No external API dependencies** - all content is bundled locally.

## Out of Scope

- No tracking, analytics, or statistics dashboard
- No user accounts or authentication
- No cloud sync
- No custom stretch creation by users
- No social features or sharing
- No App Store distribution (direct download only for MVP)

## Technical Notes

- SwiftUI + AppKit for menu bar integration (NSStatusItem)
- Stretch data stored as bundled JSON files
- User preferences in UserDefaults
- Text descriptions + detailed animations for stretch guidance (animations sourced/referenced from the web)
- Use `@Observable` macro for view models
- Target macOS 14 (Sonoma) minimum
