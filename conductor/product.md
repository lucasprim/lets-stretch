# Product Definition - Let's Stretch

## Overview

**Project Name:** Let's Stretch
**Description:** A Mac App that gives you instructions for stretches during the day.

## Problem Statement

Sedentary desk workers forget to stretch. People working at desks all day develop stiffness, pain, and poor posture from prolonged sitting without movement breaks.

## Target Users

**Primary:** Desk workers and remote workers who spend long hours at a computer.

These users:
- Sit for extended periods during work
- Know they should stretch but forget or lack motivation
- Want a simple, unobtrusive tool that fits into their workflow
- Use a Mac as their primary work machine

## Key Goals

1. **Simple, non-intrusive reminders + guided stretches** - Timely reminders with clear visual instructions for each stretch
2. **Build a healthy habit + reduce pain from sitting** - Help users develop a consistent stretching routine to prevent discomfort
3. **Mac-native, lightweight, beautiful UX** - A polished macOS app that feels native and stays out of the way

## Success Criteria

- Users complete at least one stretch session per day
- The app feels invisible until needed (non-disruptive)
- Stretching instructions are clear enough to follow without prior knowledge
